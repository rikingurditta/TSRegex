# Regular Expression Compiler

This is a regular expression compiler written in TypeScript! I made it after seeing [Thompson's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction) in my 2nd year theory of computation class (CSC236 at UofT). To build it, just run `tsc`. To see it in action, check it out on my [website](https://rikingurditta.github.io/#/projects)!
